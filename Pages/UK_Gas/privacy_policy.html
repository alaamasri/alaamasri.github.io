									<h3 class="title pb-24">UK Gas-Serve Privacy Policy</h3>
									<p>This privacy policy (&ldquo;Policy&rdquo;) describes how&nbsp;<strong>UK Gas-Serve</strong>&nbsp;(&ldquo;<strong>UK Gas-Serve</strong>&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) collects, protects and uses the personally identifiable information (&ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo;) you (&ldquo;User&rdquo;, &ldquo;you&rdquo; or &ldquo;your&rdquo;) may provide on the myconstructor.co.uk website and any of its products or services (collectively, &ldquo;Website&rdquo; or &ldquo;Services&rdquo;).<br />It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update this information. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="title pb-24">Automatic collection of information</h3>
									<p>Our top priority is customer data security and, as such, we exercise the no logs policy. We process only minimal user data, only as much as it is absolutely necessary to maintain the Website or Services. Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding Website usage. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="title pb-24">Collection of personal information</h3>
									<p>You can visit the Website without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the Website&rsquo;s features, you will be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail address). We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an account, publish content, make a purchase, or fill any online forms on the Website. When required, this information may include the following:</p>
									<ul class="stylelisting pb-20">
										<li>Personal details such as name, country of residence, etc.</li>
										<li>Contact information such as email address, address, etc.</li>
										<li>Account details such as user name, unique user ID, password, etc.</li>
										<li>Proof of identity such as photocopy of a government ID.</li>
										<li>Payment information such as credit card details, bank details, etc.</li>
										<li>Any other materials you willingly submit to us such as articles, images, feedback, etc.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Website&rsquo;s features. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="title pb-24">Managing personal information</h3>
									<p>You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you. The Personal Information you can delete may change as the Website or Services change. When you delete Personal Information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised Personal Information in our records for the duration necessary to comply with our obligations to our affiliates and partners, and for the purposes described below.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="title pb-24">Storing personal information</h3>
									<p>We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="title pb-24">Use and processing of collected information</h3>
									<p>In order to make our Website and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Some of the information we collect is directly from you via our Website. However, we may also collect Personal Information about you from other sources such as social media, emails, etc. Any of the information we collect from you may be used for the following purposes:</p>
									<ul class="stylelisting pb-20">
										<li>Create and manage user accounts</li>
										<li>Fulfill and manage orders</li>
										<li>Deliver products or services</li>
										<li>Improve products and services</li>
										<li>Send administrative information</li>
										<li>Send marketing and promotional communications</li>
										<li>Respond to inquiries and offer support</li>
										<li>Request user feedback</li>
										<li>Improve user experience</li>
										<li>Post customer testimonials</li>
										<li>Deliver targeted advertising</li>
										<li>Administer prize draws and competitions</li>
										<li>Enforce terms and conditions and policies</li>
										<li>Protect from abuse and malicious users</li>
										<li>Respond to legal requests and prevent harm</li>
										<li>Run and operate our Website and Services</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with our Website, where you are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) You have given your consent for one or more specific purposes. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to California Consumer Privacy Act or European data protection law; (ii) Provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) Processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.<br />Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="title pb-24">Information transfer and storage</h3>
									<p>Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a country other than your own. You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard your information. If any such transfer takes place, you can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire with us using the information provided in the contact section.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="title pb-24">The rights of users</h3>
									<p>You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by us. In particular, you have the right to do the following: (i) you have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given your consent to the processing of your information; (ii) you have the right to object to the processing of your information if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent; (iii) you have the right to learn if information is being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the information undergoing processing; (iv) you have the right to verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to be updated or corrected; (v) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of your information, in which case, we will not process your information for any purpose other than storing it; (vi) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from us; (vii) you have the right to receive your information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance. This provision is applicable provided that your information is processed by automated means and that the processing is based on your consent, on a contract which you are part of or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="title pb-24">The right to object to processing</h3>
									<p>Where Personal Information is processed for the public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in us or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation to justify the objection. You must know that, however, should your Personal Information be processed for direct marketing purposes, you can object to that processing at any time without providing any justification. To learn, whether we are processing Personal Information for direct marketing purposes, you may refer to the relevant sections of this document.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="title pb-24">How to exercise these rights?</h3>
									<p>Any requests to exercise User rights can be directed to the Owner through the contact details provided in this document. These requests can be exercised free of charge and will be addressed by the Owner as early as possible.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="title pb-24">Billing and payments</h3>
									<p>In case of services requiring payment, we request credit card or other payment account information, which will be used solely for processing payments. Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted. All direct payment gateways adhere to the latest security standards as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. Scans for malware are performed on a regular basis for additional security and protection.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="title pb-24">Product and service providers</h3>
									<p>We may contract with other companies to provide certain products and services. These service providers are not authorized to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. We may share Personal Information for these purposes only with third-parties whose privacy policies are consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our policies with respect to Personal Information Our service providers are given the information they need to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose Personal Information for their own marketing or other purposes.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="title pb-24">Privacy of children</h3>
									<p>We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Information through our Website or Service. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children&rsquo;s Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through our Website or Service without their permission.<br />If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us through our Website or Service, please contact us. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your Personal Information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="title pb-24">Newsletters</h3>
									<p>We offer electronic newsletters to which you may voluntarily subscribe at any time. We are committed to keeping your e-mail address confidential and will not disclose your email address to any third parties except as allowed in the information use and processing section or for the purposes of utilizing a third-party provider to send such emails. We will maintain the information sent via e-mail in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.<br />In compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act, all e-mails sent from us will clearly state who the e-mail is from and provide clear information on how to contact the sender. You may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails or by contacting us. However, you will continue to receive essential transactional emails.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="title pb-24">Cookies</h3>
									<p>The Website uses &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.<br />We may use cookies to collect, store, and track information for statistical purposes to operate our Website and Services. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the features of the Website and Services. To learn more about cookies and how to manage them, visit internetcookies.org<br />In addition to using cookies and related technologies as described above, we also may permit certain third-party companies to help us tailor advertising that we think may be of interest to users and to collect and use other data about user activities on the Website. These companies may deliver ads that might also place cookies and otherwise track user behavior.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="title pb-24">Do Not Track signals</h3>
									<p>Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use or visit a website or online service as they move across different websites over time. How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform. As a result, this Website is not yet set up to interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by your browser. Even so, as described in more detail throughout this Policy, we limit our use and collection of your personal information.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="title pb-24">Affiliates</h3>
									<p>We may disclose information about you to our affiliates for the purpose of being able to offer you related or additional products and services. Any information relating to you that we provide to our affiliates will be treated by those affiliates in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="title pb-24">Links to other websites</h3>
									<p>Our Website contains links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by us.

We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Website and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that may collect Personal Information.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="title pb-24">Information security</h3>
									<p>We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of Personal Information in its control and custody. However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed.

									<p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="title pb-24">Data breach</h3>
									<p>In the event we become aware that the security of the Website has been compromised or users Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the user as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we do, we will send you an email.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="title pb-24">Legal disclosure</h3>
									<p>We will disclose any information we collect, use or receive if required or permitted by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

									<p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="title pb-24">Changes and amendments</h3>
									<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in our discretion and will notify you of any material changes to the way in which we treat Personal Information. When changes are made, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page.
